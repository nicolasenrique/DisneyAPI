Please refer to "API_documentation.md" in order to use the app. 

Sequelize main tables is in the folder named "SQL". I've also added some mock tables for testing in the following route: SQL/tableData. 

IMPORTANT: Execute the "characterMovieData" after executing all other tables (given it's a many to many table).

You should configure your local .env file with your Sendgrid Key and TOKEN KEY.

Cheers,
